The Student Attendance Management System Project In Python was developed using Python OpenCV in Real-Time, This Attendance Management System Project In Python provide a valuable attendance service for both teachers and students. Reduce manual process errors by provide automated and a reliable attendance system uses face recognition technology.
A Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition Python is a simple python script that recognizes faces and mark attendance for the recognized faces in an excel sheet. We seek to provide a valuable attendance service for both teachers and students. Reduce manual process errors by provide automated and a reliable attendance system uses face recognition technology.
